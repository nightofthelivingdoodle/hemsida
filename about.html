  <h1>About the Artist</h1>

  <p>
    Emma Karolina is a multidisciplinary artist based in Lund, Sweden, where she has lived most of her adult life. Raised in the forests of northern Skåne, she carries a strong connection to nature and craftsmanship into her artistic process.
  </p>

  <p>
    With a background in silversmithing, ceramics, oil painting, textiles, and woodworking, Emma Karolina has always explored the world with her hands. Her current focus is detailed black-and-white drawings in mixed media, a shift that began in the fall of 2023. Her imagery is often dreamlike or unsettling—playing with tenderness, contradiction, absurdity, and resilience. Influenced by themes of dystopia, post-apocalyptic worlds, and imagined futures, her work balances sharp social undercurrents with a quiet sense of humor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although now rooted in Lund, Emma Karolina has lived and traveled across the globe, and her work reflects the layered impressions of those experiences. For her, every piece begins without a fixed destination. Curiosity drives the process forward—she draws to see what will happen, what will emerge. It’s an unfolding rather than a plan, a kind of visual exploration that invites both accident and intention.
